# hello-world
My first Github Repository

Hopefully this GitHub really does everything that I think it can do and then some.  What's up with these public files though?  Is it worth $7 a month to keep my files to myself?  I think I could potentially gain access to someone else's website through viewing all the files associated with this site.  I guess this is another process along the way that I will have to research and research in order to make the most informed decisions for my potential clients.  $7 a month is only $84 a year.  Between this and MS Office, I think I might just have to commit to having some monthly payments in order to keep my career opportunities alive.
